I am an experienced data scientist skilled in delivering a wide range of data-driven solutions, including exploratory data analysis, ML and AI integration, statistical models development and interactive dashboard creation (also directly with Python). My background in Physics and Engineering enables me to deeply engage and significantly contribute in projects with complex topics, such as AI-based missile detection and carbon footprint monitoring in machinery.

I have led projects successfully with a structured agile workflow, which required dynamic team cooperation and flexible adjustments to timely targets. Moreover, after many years of research in academia and active participation in renowned research communities such as CERN, ATLAS, and CALICE, I have given the opportunity to launch and supervised several international collaborations in AI research. My main activities included engaging with the graduate school EURECOM, the Munich Aerospace program and within the scope of Horizon EU funding program.

The CliftonStrengths (Gallup) assessment highlights my key attributes as a Learner, Responsibility, Achiever, Arranger, and Developer. These strengths guide me in overcoming challenges and drive me to relentlessly pursue excellence in my work.
